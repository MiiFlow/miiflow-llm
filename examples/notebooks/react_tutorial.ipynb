    "This notebook demonstrates the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** pattern for building AI agents that can reason about problems and take actions to solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct is an agent architecture that combines reasoning and acting in an interleaved manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Think**: The agent reasons about what it needs to do\n",
    "2. **Act**: The agent calls a tool to gather information or perform an action\n",
    "3. **Observe**: The agent receives the tool's result\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: The cycle continues until the agent has enough information to answer\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Question → Think → Act → Observe → Think → Act → Observe → ... → Final Answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern enables agents to break down complex tasks, gather real-world data, and provide informed responses."

    "   - Simple to moderately complex queries\n",
    "   - Questions requiring real-world data lookup\n",
    "   - Tasks where the number of steps is unknown upfront\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key parameters**:\n",
    "   - `agent_type=AgentType.REACT` - enables ReAct mode\n",
    "   - `max_iterations` - limits reasoning cycles (safety)\n",
    "   - `system_prompt` - sets agent behavior\n",

    "4. **Tools**: Functions decorated with `@tool` that the agent can call\n",
